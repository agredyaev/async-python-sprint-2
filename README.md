## Project Overview

This project analyzes weather conditions using data from the Yandex Weather API. The task involves retrieving weather data for a list of cities, calculating the average temperature and analyzing precipitation conditions for a specific period within a day.

### Key Features
- **FetchTask**: Fetches weather data from an external API (e.g., YandexWeatherAPI).
- **ExtractTask**: Extracts and validates relevant weather data.
- **TransformTask**: Processes and transforms raw weather data into structured formats.
- **AnalyzeTask**: Analyzes transformed data to compute key metrics like weather scores.
